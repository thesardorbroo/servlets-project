# servlets-project
The project is built at Java Servlets and there used to JDBC Template to exchanging data with database. 

Spring Security's logic is added to project. It can authorize and authenticate requests, but the logic isn't set to all sections, temporarly. If you want to see that then see the class java.service.TaskService.addNewTask().

Soon, we wanna add method that can get txt file, and app send this to another service(telegram bot) with Rest Template, in sha Allah.
